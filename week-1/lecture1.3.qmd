## ggplot review


### Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Tidy data
```{r}
# untidy data ----
# untidy bc each row represents multiple observations
# here you have 3 numerical columns it's hard to plot with just x,y axis
# each observation is a column when it should be a row (station #)

temp_data_wide <- tribble(
  ~date, ~station1, ~station2,  ~station3,
  "2023-10-01", 30.1, 29.8,  31.2,
  "2023-11-01", 28.6, 29.1,  33.4,
  "2023-12-01", 29.9, 28.5,  32.3
)

# make tidy ----
temp_data_long <- temp_data_wide %>% 
  #any column name that starts with station will be included in the pivot
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("station"), 
               # column names we want to create
               names_to = "station_id", 
               # column our values were stuffed into
               values_to = "temp_c")

```
